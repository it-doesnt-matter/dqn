# Goals
- gain an understanding of DQN and some of its variants
- get some experience implementing algorithms based of research papers
- get familiar with Pytroch and Gymnasium

Since this project is purely for educational purposes and is not intended for further use, the code quality is not at production level (missing exception handling, no documentation, no tests, ...).

# Possible Future Additions
- gradient clipping
- Ape-X DQN
